# Grab Grub APP

Is the front end (app) for the Grabgrub project.

University-organized events end up with humongous food wastage. GrabGrub can help reduce wastage by distributing this food among students. GrabGrub helps you reach a potentially larger student group, willing to accept the food, through the applicationâ€™s posting feature. With our application, you can spend less time trying to manage the food and focus on the event.

## Getting Started
